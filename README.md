Miwok App
===================================

This app displays lists of vocabulary words for the user to learn the Miwok language.
This is a custom version of the app created by me with the help of Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree Program.

Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android SDK v23
- Android Build Tools v23.0.2
- Android Support Repository v23.3.0

Getting Started
---------------

This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
"gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

PURPOSE OF REPO
---------------
This acts as a reference for reviewing my concepts on CustomArrayAdapters, ArrayList, Classes etc.
